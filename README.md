# ConditionalLove

This repository contains the code and data to reproduce the analysis described in:
de Jonge, M. M. J., Benítez-López, A., Hennekens, S., Santini, L., Huijbregts, M. A. J. & Schipper, A. M. <i>Contitional love? Evidence for the stress gradient hypothesis in dry grasslands across Euope.</i> 

Code and data needed to reproduce the pre-processing steps are not made available due to restrictions on publication of third party data. 

The following steps should be taken to replicate the Joint-SDMs described in the paper: 

Step 1: Run the main model for 800 runs of 2500 iterations saving only every tenth iteration in MATLAB using run_model(1,800,250,10,3). You can also run the static model with run_static_model(1,800,250,3). The posterior estimates generated by this step are saved in the output folder. WARNING: This step may take a long time, in the order weeks. 

Step 2: Check the convergence the beta parameters of the model using check_convergence('Conditional',1,0) and of the static model using check_convergence('Static',1,0);

Step 3: If the models are converged combine the postiors of the runs after discard the burnin period (600 runs) into one model object and calculate the residual correlations of the species using finalize_model('Conditional',1,600,10) and finalize_model('Static',1,600,10).

To replicate the analysis of the model and figures:
