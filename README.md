# ConditionalLove

The following steps should be taken to replicate the results described in the paper: 

Step 1: Run the main model in MATLAB using run_model(1,800,250,10,3). WARNING: This step may take a long time, in the order weeks. 

Step 2: Check the convergence the beta parameters of the model using check_convergence('Conditional',1,1)
